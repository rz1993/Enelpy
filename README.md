# Natural Language Processing Notebooks
A series of natural language processing notebooks progressing from low-level tasks, such as stemming, lemmatization, POS-tagging, to high level tasks such as sentiment analysis and summarization. Introduces a variety of models for these tasks from rule-based to traditional ML models to RNNs.

## Notebooks
- Stemming and lemmatization `in progress`
- POS tagging and Named Entity Recognition `in progress`
- Word Embeddings `in progress`
- Language models `in progress`
- Syntactic Parsing (Dependency and CFG Parsing) `in progress`
- Sentiment and Topic Modeling `in progress`
- Summarization `in progress`

## Models Implemented
- Averaged Perceptron POS tagger
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation via Collapsed Gibbs Sampler

## Neural Models
- word2vec with negative sampling, subsampling and adjustable context windows
- LSTM + Linear Chain CRF for named entity recognition

## Libraries and tools used
- `spaCy` - for abstracting low level tasks in higher level ones
- `scikit-learn` - for implementing feature extraction and machine learning models
- `tensorflow` - for implementing deep learning models
- `keras` - for higher level deep learning model implementation
- `matplotlib` - for visualizations
